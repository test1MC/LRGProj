        <p class="Body">The single form order entry screens consist of the most common order header fields, arranged in layout frames, followed by order line sections that allow you to enter the different types of order line. Other, less commonly used header fields are available at the bottom of the page. The fields available on the screens vary according to the type of order being raised (just as in the standard PO entry screens).</p>

        <p class="Body">The single form order entry screens can only be used for adding new orders; the standard order update screens must be used for updating orders. There is an option on the single form order entry screens to open the new order in the Order Summary screen as soon as it is saved.</p>
