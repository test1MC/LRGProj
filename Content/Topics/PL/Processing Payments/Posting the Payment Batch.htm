        <p>The Payment Batch should only be posted once all the Cheques and <MadCap:variable name="Variables.eft" /> Remittances have been successfully generated.&#160; Before the batch is posted it is possible to unfreeze the batch, make changes to the payment batch, refreeze the batch and re-process the payment run (ensure you re-generate any paperwork to reflect your changes) </p>
        <p>Once the batch has been posted it will no longer be possible to make any corrections to the payment run and the Supplier accounts will be updated with the payment details.</p>
