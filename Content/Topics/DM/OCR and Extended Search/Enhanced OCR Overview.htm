            <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="COINS.ScreenOnly">Enhanced OCR </MadCap:conditionalText>Overview</h1>
        <p>The accuracy and functionality of using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> invoices has been improved, to automatically generate OCR layouts wherever possible, without any manual input. Full-page OCR is performed when an image is imported, and the results are stored and used to pre-populate fields on <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> invoice input. New screens allow you to set up OCR aliases, which are used to map <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> database field names to on-screen words as read by the OCR process.
</p>
        <p>The way data is read from the OCR stream has been improved to allow the OCR engine to locate data which falls just outside the search parameters.</p>
