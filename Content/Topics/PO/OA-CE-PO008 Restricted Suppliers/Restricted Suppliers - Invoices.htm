        <p class="Body">If you enter an invoice that relates to a material or <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pc plant" /> order and the PL account is overridden, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will check that the supplier is a valid supplier from the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />'s restricted supplier list.</p>
        <p class="Body">If you enter a manual <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> or Subcontract Ledger payment for a supplier or subcontractor, and leave any part of the payment unallocated against a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> that has a restricted supplier or subcontractor list, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will check that the supplier or subcontractor is a valid company from the restricted list. </p>
        <p class="Body">Similarly, during Apply Payments entry, if you leave any part of the payment unallocated against a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> that has a restricted supplier or subcontractor list, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will check that the supplier or subcontractor is a valid company from the restricted list. </p>
        <p class="Body">If you enter through <span style="text-transform: capitalize;">cash book</span> for either a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.Purchase Ledger caps" /> or Subcontract Ledger account, and select a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />on an analysis line, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will check that the supplier or subcontractor is valid for that <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />, and if you leave any part of the payment unallocated against a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" /> that has a restricted supplier or subcontractor list, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> will check that the supplier or subcontractor is a valid company from the restricted list. </p>
