        <p class="Body">You can restrict which <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> and subcontractors it is possible to procure from on any specific <MadCap:variable name="Variables.jc contract" />. This allows you to establish a list of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl suppliers" /> and subcontractors that can be given a PO, and ensure that buyers work within agreed boundaries. Similarly you can prevent PL invoices that are received from a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.pl supplier" /> in these circumstances from being registered or costed.</p>
