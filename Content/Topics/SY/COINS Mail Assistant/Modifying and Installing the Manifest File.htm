        <p class="Body">The <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Mail Assistant manifest is an XML&#160;file that tells the Outlook client where to find the Mail Assistant and its associated files. The manifest file is provided as part of the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Mail Assistant installation package.</p>
        <p class="Body">To use <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Mail Assistant, each <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> environment needs a different version of the manifest file. Unless <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> has provided you with a pre-configured version of the file, you will need to modify the file to point to the correct locations on your environment (see <MadCap:xref href="Modifying the Mail Assistant Manifest File.htm">1, Modifying the COINS Mail Assistant Manifest File</MadCap:xref>). Then the manifest file needs to be installed on Exchange and made available to your users (see <MadCap:xref href="Installing the COINS Mail Assistant Manifest File.htm">1, Installing the COINS Mail Assistant Manifest File</MadCap:xref>).</p>
