    <p>Employees and pension providers need to receive various notifications relating to the process of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.enrolment" />. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> automatically generates notification records as appropriate. In addition, you need to record manually if employees opt into or out of a qualifying pension scheme.</p>
    <p>You can manage the notification records either for an individual employee, using the Notifications browse on the Other tab in Employee Maintenance, or using the Employee Notifications browses (one for each pay frequency). These show all notifications (both generated notifications and those added manually) and allow you to add and update notifications manually. This is subject to employee security.</p>

      <p>You then need to either run the Notifications Report or use the mail-merge feature on the Notifications browse to send notifications by email, generate merged documents, or generate a spreadsheet that can be used as a data file for a mail merge.</p>
      <p>Entry of a notification from the employee to the employer (that is, begins WE) will warn you if the employee is in the calculated state, which will prompt you to reset the employee.</p>
