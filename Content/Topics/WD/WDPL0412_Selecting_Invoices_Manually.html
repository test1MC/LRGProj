    <ul>
      <li>To pay the full amount of a transaction, <a href="WDUG0026_Selecting_Records.html">select</a> the transaction(s) and choose <span class="field">Pay Invoices </span>from the list. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> completes the <span class="field">Amount Paid </span>and <span class="field">Discount Taken </span>fields for you.</li>
      <li>To part-pay a transaction, click <img src="../../Resources/Images/COINS Graphics/SVG buttons/open.svg" class="button" />. The <span class="field">Amount Paid </span>and <span class="field">Discount Taken </span>fields become input fields.

    </ul>
    <p>You can also select credit transactions, which will adjust the amount of the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.cheque" /> accordingly.  For further details about making payments using credit transactions, see <a href="WDPL0211_Credit_Notes.html">Credit Notes</a>.</p>
    <p class="noteheader">NOTE</p>
    <div class="note">If you select an invoice containing a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.labour" /> element, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> may not allow payment if the subcontractor does not meet certain requirements (see the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /><a href="WDSC0730_Subcontractor_Warning_Messages.html">SC Ledger Basics - Subcontractor Warning Messages</a> for details). </div>
