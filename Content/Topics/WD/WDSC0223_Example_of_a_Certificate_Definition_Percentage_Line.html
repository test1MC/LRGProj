    <h1 class="print">Example of a Certificate Definition - Percentage Line</h1>
    <p>Suppose retention is calculated as 5% of the Total Cost amount. The Retention line looks like this:</p>
    <p>
      <img src="../../Resources/Images/SC/SC_022301.png" class="HalfWidth" />
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Note that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The retention calculation is based on the Total Cost line (line 200), so the <span class="field">Subtotals</span> line is +200.</li>
      <li>The user is to be able to override the retention, so the <span class="field">Update</span> field is <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />ed.</li>
      <li>Retention is to be held in a retention account, so the code for that <span class="module">General Ledger </span>account is entered in the <span class="field">Account </span>field.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To display values such as retention as negative values, create a display line that subtracts the retention line from a blank line.</p>
