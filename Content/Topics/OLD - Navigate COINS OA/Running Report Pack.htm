        <p class="Body"><b class="Field">Report Pack</b>
        </p>
        <p class="IndentFieldDef">The report pack to be run.&#160; The current pack is preselected but it is possible to select a different report pack.</p>
        <p class="IndentFieldDef">Only report packs that are relevant to the current company are shown.</p>
        <p class="Body"><b class="Field">Run Date</b>
        </p>
        <p class="IndentFieldDef">The date for the offset calculations.&#160; The dates for each of the saved or scheduled reports in the pack are calculated based on this date.&#160; Typically you would enter the end of the period and it might calculate the range of dates that are the start and end of that period for the reports to run.</p>
        <p class="Body">This causes each of the reports in the report pack to be run (one at a time and in the sequence defined).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">All reports are generated as individual reports, but when all reports are complete those that are marked as output = Report Pack are consolidated in the PDF and Excel output for the report pack (the first entry on the queue).&#160; Those that are defined as output = Separate are excluded from the consolidated PDF and Excel.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">Each consolidated report in the Excel output is placed on a separate tab.</p>
        <p class="Body">If you email the report pack, reports marked as Separate are sent as separate emails, and those marked as Report Pack are sent as a combined report of all the grouped reports. </p>
