        <p class="Body">Exclamation Marks are used to exclude records, words, codes or values from a list. These are looking for a match in the Search field when excluding data. </p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">Using this wildcard would normally be used in conjunction with others, as if you are excluding something, you would require everything else, i.e. exclude all orders on the 14<sup>th</sup> April 2010 however show me everything else. </p>
        <p class="Body">When using the exclude Filter this has to go before any other search filters as shown above.</p>
