            <p>How <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> responds if a construction stage is marked as complete but is greater than the current release stage for the plot.</p>
            <p>If <span class="parameter">CSVALREL </span>is not blank, then when a construction stage is recorded as complete through input of a construction stage event (either directly or indirectly), <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> validates that the stage is no greater than the current build release stage for the plot. If this validation fails, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> responds depending on the setting below:</p>
            <p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">Error</span> = The user will be prevented from completing the input and will receive a message "<span class="sysmsg">Error: Stage cannot be completed ? this plot is only build released to stage &lt;stage&gt;</span>".</p>
            <p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">Warning</span> = The user will be able to complete the input but will receive a message "<span class="sysmsg">Warning: this plot is only build released to stage &lt;stage&gt;</span>".</p>
            <p class="yesnolist">blank = <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> does not validate the construction progress against the build release.</p>
