<span class="parameter">EC/REJEMAIL - </span> Trigger for invoice rejection email
</div>
<div class="param_def">
<p>When the <span class="function" title="Function:%WPL9011BSMPG">eCommerce Invoices</span> produces rejection emails.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">CREATE</span> = Rejection emails are produced when the <span class="userinput">Create </span>action is used.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">REVIEW</span> = Rejection emails are produced when a batch of eInvoices is reviewed in the workbench.</p>
<p class="yesnolist"><span class="userinput">REJECT</span> = Rejection emails are produced when the <span class="userinput">Reject </span>action is used.</p>
<p>The parameter may be set to <span class="userinput">REVIEW,REJECT </span>in which case two emails will be produced for each invoice in error (once when reviewed and once when rejected). Emails are only produced according to the rules in <span class="function" title="Function:%WEC2000BCTA">Validation Error Codes</span>. The same applies if the parameter is set to <span class="userinput">REVIEW,REJECT,CREATE</span>.</p>
<p>Leaving the parameter blank or setting it to <span class="userinput">NONE </span>overrides the validation rules however they are set and no email is produced. The AUTOREJECT functionality is not affected by this parameter.<br /></p>
