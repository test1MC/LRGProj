            <MadCap:concept term="Parameters" /><span class="parameter">SY/UFACCESS - </span> User function access date/time
</div>
        <div class="param_def">
            <p>The date and time stamp for compiled user security.  This can speed up access to functions because <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> only needs to consult one table to evaluate whether a user has access. </p>
            <P>To enable compiled function security, enter an exclamation mark (<SPAN class="userinput">!</SPAN>) as the value of this parameter. </P>
            <P>When the next user logs in, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> stamps the parameter with the date and time. From then on, the first time a user accesses a function, <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> checks the access permissions for the user, and records whether the user has permission to access the function.  Subsequent access requests are quicker because <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> can consult just one table to evaluate whether a user has access.  </P>
            <P>If user groups, roles, or group security are changed after compiled function security has been enabled, you must re-set the parameter to <SPAN class="userinput">!</SPAN> for the updated security settings to take effect.  This has the effect of making all the previously-saved security settings invalid; <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> then re-evaluates and saves permissions (as when this feature is originally switched on). </P>
            <P>If the parameter is left blank - or restored to blank - then this functionality is not applied and <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> evaluates function access every time.</P>
