            <MadCap:concept term="Topics" />Adding Offices to a Company</h1>
        <p>Companies can have many offices using the One to Many ratio, i.e. only one record for the Company and many office records. </p>
        <p>You should not have the same company entered in the system more than once and therefore each office becomes an additional record against the main company record. It is on the office that the order is placed rather than the head office, so we recommend that you have all the offices entered into the system. </p>
        <p>When adding an office, you will need to locate the company on the Company Information Workbench.</p>
