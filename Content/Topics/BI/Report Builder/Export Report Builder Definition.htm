        </p>
        <p>Select the reports that you want to export and select the Export Report Builder action from the drop down list.</p>
        <p>The next screen will show the list of reports to be exported and the list of data sources that will be exported with it. </p>
        <p> In the example below, the first of the reports uses a AVMTEST data source so it is listed.  The second report uses a custom data source specific to the report so it is not listed in the data sources.</p>
        <p>The report data fields is the exported data that you can copy ready to paste in to the import function.</p>
