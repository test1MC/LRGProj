        <p>A option is available on the report build list to allow you to import report builder configurations (and their data sources and data sets).</p>

        </p>
        <p>Paste in the report data that was previously exported</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/Report Builder/Import_2_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If any of the import parts already exist in the database then you will receive a warning to confirm that you want to overwrite them</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>If you confirm this then report section, form, fields, calculations, data source, dataset and fields, and collection dataset will be imported as required.</p>
        <p>You can check that the data source, dataset and collection dataset have been created by looking in the corresponding maintenance pages for these items.</p>
