        </p>
        <p>To create a new report, select the New icon<img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 24px;height: 22px;" />.</p>

            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_3.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>In this panel, assign a code and description to the report.&#160; The code will be used to identify the report later on and the description should contain a brief overview of the purpose of this report so that others Users will know what it does.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_4.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>You will then need to select a Query from the pre-defined cache of queries.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_5.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Click on the Lookup button <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_6.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 19px;height: 18px;" /> to view all the available queries.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_7.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>A Query is a pre-defined section of PROGRESS 4GL code that selects the records that the report will include. <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> comes with a large number of pre-installed queries and your system administrator may also have added some additional queries for your use. </p>
        <p>NOTE : Queries are filtered by table security; you will only see queries for which you have access to all the tables.</p>
        <p>To help you find the query you need, a filter is provided in the lower right-hand side of the screen</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_8.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>You may search by Query Code, Query description, or the data tables used by the query.&#160; Remember to press the filter button <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_9.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 29px;height: 23px;" /> when you change the filter selection.</p>
        <p>You can modify the basic queries later on by setting up filters, groups and sort orders.</p>
        <p>The queries will extract the basic information for the report from the database and in some instances provide default Report Selection criteria. Select the query required and assign to the report using the Choose button <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_10.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 28px;height: 26px;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1pt;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1pt;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1pt;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1pt;" /> .</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_11.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If you want to report on a selected number of records then you can enter a number in the Maximum Rows field to limit the number of rows on the report. (Eg:- useful if you want to report on the Top 5).&#160; Leave this blank to run a full report.</p>
        <p>If a graph is required on the report then select the graph type to be included on report. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_12.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Using the Report Totals <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" /> box, confirm whether you want the report to have run totals at the end of the report. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_13.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>It is also necessary to confirm the Page Layout (this can be selected from a predefined list of standard options) and Class (again this can be selected from a predefined list of standard options). </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_14.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The Page Layout determines the paper size and orientation and the report class will determine font, size and formatting of the body text of the report. </p>
        <p>Once you have assigned all of the above information Click <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Report Writer_15.png" style="width: 24px;height: 24px;" /> to save the report.</p>
