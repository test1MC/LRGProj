        <p>The options under the Group Tab define how the data will be sorted on your report.&#160; </p>

        </p>
        <p>In the Group By column, select the field you want to group the report by.&#160; Records on which the value of this field are the same will be grouped together and sorted in the order you specify, and you can show totals for each group.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>In the Label column, enter a label to show on the headers and footers (before and after each group).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Sorting Sub totalling Page_2.png" class="HalfWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" />

        </p>
        <p>NOTE : Your system administrator may set up more detailed group headers (using Default Report Labels), which show, for example, a code and a description for each group.</p>
        <p>Choose whether to sort the group in ascending or descending order.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Sorting Sub totalling Page_3.png" style="width: 120px; height: 138px;" class="HalfWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" />
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Sorting Sub totalling Page_3_1105.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Choose whether or not to display group headers (a label and the value of the group by field) before each group, and group footers (a label and the value of the group field, plus the totals of any totalled columns).</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Sorting Sub totalling Page_4.png" class="HalfWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" />
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Sorting Sub totalling Page_4_1105.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If you want the report to start on a new page when the value of one of the fields changes (for example, to print information about different contracts on separate pages), use Page Level to select the field.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Sorting Sub totalling Page_5.png" class="FullWidth" MadCap:conditions="COINS.Pre-v1105" />
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/BI/OA Report Writer/Sorting Sub totalling Page_5_1105.png" class="HalfWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If you want to produce a summarised report based on details that you do not want to show, use Summary Level to select the field to summarise by.</p>
        <p>For example, if you want to produce a report on contract costs by section, you could produce a cost code report, but summarised by section. This would show the cost code totals for each section, but would not show the individual costs for each cost code.</p>
        <p class="note">Experiment with the options to see the diverse effects.</p>
