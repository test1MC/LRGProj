        <p>Report Writer licences are based on a Named Used licence. To assign a licence to a User, (once the appropriate module has been licensed via the branding screen) access the User record and click the appropriate licence.</p>
        <p>Report Runner licences are based on a Named Used licence and can be assigned in the same manner as the Report Writer licence</p>
