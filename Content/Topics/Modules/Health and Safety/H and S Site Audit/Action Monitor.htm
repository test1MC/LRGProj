        </p>
        <p class="Body">Actions always belong to a <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> user, but can be assigned to other people (for example, to subcontractors or contacts).</p>
        <h2>Task Notes</h2>
        <p class="Body">On the task summary, there is a new tab for Notes on the task.&#160; When a task is added the date, time and user are stamped on the record.&#160; The notes browse has columns for date/time, user and the note text.&#160; In display mode the text shows the first few lines.&#160; Detail view shows the whole text of the note.</p>
        <h2>Task Email </h2>
        <p class="Body">An Email button has been added to the <span class="Function">Action Monitor</span> browse and the task summary.&#160; When clicked this opens a page to allow you to enter details of the email.&#160;There are fields for Assignee type and Assignee, Email To and Cc, Subject and Message.&#160; The default text for the subject and message are defined by the parameters <span class="parameter">TSKMSUBJ</span> and <span class="parameter">TSKMBODY</span> (see <MadCap:xref href="Health and Safety Parameters.htm">1 , Health and Safety Parameters</MadCap:xref>).</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">When the email is sent, a task note is automatically created with details of the email and content sent, and if an Assignee was set the action is assigned to the person emailed.</p>
        <p class="Body">If a task is already assigned, the Assignee and Email To will default from this.&#160; </p>
        <p class="Body">The Attachment tab lists any documents linked to the section and element of the form that the task relates to, with a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.tick" />box selection of whether the image should be attached. You can hover over the attachment to preview the image.</p>
