        <p class="Body">On the My Files tab the selector allows you to pick your own home directory or one of the shared directories to which you have READ access.</p>
        <p class="Body">The Get File tab has a combo selector to allow you to get a file from a specific folder.&#160; This is just another option to get a file and provides the same functionality that is available on the My Files tab by selecting the appropriate folder.</p>
        <p class="Body">You can only GET files from directories to which you have been granted access to the READ function as defined on the shared folder configuration.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="Body">The GET will default to your home directory.</p>
        <p class="Body">Similarly the Put File tab allows you to select the target folder for the uploaded file.</p>
