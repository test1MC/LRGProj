        <p>This “How-to” guide helps you understand the procedures required to successfully perform a Year-End in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> allows two consecutive financial years, at a total of 24 or 26* periods to be open and available for posting at a time. Any financial years prior to these two years are available for reporting purposes only. When the Year-End procedure is run, the older of the two current years on the system is closed.</p>
        <p>The financial year is denoted in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> by the calendar name of the year in which the financial year ends – e.g. the financial year running from April 2010 – March 2011 is denoted as 2011.</p>
        <p>NB. Before commencing the Year-End procedures, it is strongly recommended that you make an up-to-date backup of your database. In addition, if you are unsure for any reason, make a copy of live and prove the results beforehand.</p>
