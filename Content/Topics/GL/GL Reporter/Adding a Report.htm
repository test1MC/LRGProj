        <p>In most cases it is recommended that you copy an existing report and make any amendments required. Using this method would enable you to use a report that is similar to your requirements. </p>
        <p class="Body">However there are situations when you may want to start from the beginning. </p>
        <p class="Body">
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/GL/GL Reporter/Adding a Report.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 446px;height: 182px;" />
        </p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal; start='1'">
            <li class="ListParagraph">Select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add </span>button to configure a new report.<p>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">Add Report</span> screen is displayed. </p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/GL/GL Reporter/Adding a Report_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 309px;height: 121px;" /></p><p>The screen has two sections, the header, containing the report code and title and the lower half has the initial configuration information with details about the page layout, length etc. </p></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Enter an abbreviated name of the report in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Report</span> field. <p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/GL/GL Reporter/Adding a Report_2.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 383px;height: 66px;" /></p><p>Try and keep the code meaningful to the type of report you are creating. Use capital letters, no spaces and avoid the &amp; character, as it is a Code. In our example we have entered PL_DETAIL = profit and Loss detailed Report. The report code must be a unique report name and can be up to 8 characters. This report code cannot be changed once this report is saved. If you need to rename this report will need to make a copy of the report.</p></li>
            <li class="ListParagraph">Enter the full name of the report in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Title</span> field. You should be able to tell what the report is about if you look at the Title and Description. Do not use symbols, for example <span style="font-weight: bold;">&amp;</span>, always use <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span>. <p class="ListParagraph">It is recommended that the name given is meaningful to the report and bears some relation to the report code e.g. Profit and Loss Detailed Report = PL_DETAIL. The details of the layout for the report can be entered in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Configuration Tab</span>. </p></li>
