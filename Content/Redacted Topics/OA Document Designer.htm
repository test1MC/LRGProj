        <h1>OA Document Designer</h1>
        <p>Due to differences in the design components for the different documents, this HOW TO… guide is intended to be used in conjunction with the <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> on-line help.</p>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> Document Designer allows you to configure documents, such as statements or subcontractor certificates, based on your requirements.&#160; </p>
        <p>Configurable documents consist of a header, a body and a footer:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Introduction or Executive.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 126px;height: 117px;" />
        </p>
        <p>These are called forms. The body form of a document typically consists of a single line which is repeated; for example, a line showing the details of each invoice on a statement.</p>
        <p>If the body runs to more than one page, the document needs continuation header and footer forms:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Introduction or Executive_1.png" style="visibility: visible;mso-wrap-style: square;width: 410px;height: 129px;" />
        </p>
        <p>Note that continuation headers appear on all pages except the first, and continuation footers appear on all pages except the last; the header only appears on the first page, and the footer only appears on the last page. Continuation headers and footers can be different heights from headers and footers</p>
        <p>For example, an invoice header might show the details of the supplier, delivery details, payment terms etc., while the continuation header might repeat only the invoice number and supplier name.</p>
