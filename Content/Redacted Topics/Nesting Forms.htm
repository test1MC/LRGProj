        <h1>Nesting Forms</h1>
        <p>You can include one form in another. This allows you to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply formatting (for example, borders and shading) to several fields together. </li>
            <li>Define blocks of fields that you can arrange relative to each other. </li>
            <li>Define blocks of fields or text that you can use more than once (for example, on both a header and a continuation header). </li>
        </ul>
        <p>For example, if you want to show the contract name and address in different boxes, like this: </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Defining the Content of the_8.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>You could set up a form for the contract name, and a form for the address:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Defining the Content of the_9.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Then include them on a line in the HEAD form, adding a border and extra formatting. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Configurable Forms/Defining the Content of the_10.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p> (Note the second line, which defines a blank space between the two boxes.) </p>
