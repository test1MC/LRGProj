        <p class="Body">You may wish to go back the previous screen when using <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" />, especially when you have added filters to a browse screen or workbench. </p>
        <p class="Body">If you select the option again from the menu, you will lose all the filters you have input. </p>
        <p class="Body">Using the back and forward buttons is the best way to keep your filters. This is available as each page is separate and therefore can be recalled. </p>
