        <h1>Saved Filters</h1>
        <p>From v11.06 A new button <img src="../../Resources/Images/OA Navigation/Saved_Filters_button_1106.png" />is now available in the footer button bar.</p>
        <p>There are no parameters to enable this feature – it is automatically made available generically on all browse screens that have filtering.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/OA Navigation/Saved_Filters_2_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>If you press this new button then a dialog will allow you to save the current active filter.  You should enter and apply the filter before pressing the save filter button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/OA Navigation/Saved_Filters_3_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Select Create New Filter and enter the filter name. On OK the screen is refreshed and the filter is selected.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/OA Navigation/Saved_Filters_4_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>The additional delete button alongside allows you to delete the saved filter.</p>
        <p>If you press the save filter button again then you get to select to overwrite the existing filter with a new filter or to choose “Create New Filter” and type in a new one.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/OA Navigation/Saved_Filters_5_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>Advanced filters can also be saved.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/OA Navigation/Saved_Filters_6_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>You are then able to select a saved filter in the filter button bar.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/OA Navigation/Saved_Filters_7_1106.png" class="FullWidth" />
        </p>
        <p>When you select a filter it is the same as filling in the filter fields and applying the filter button.</p>
        <p>The following filter elements are saved:</p>
        <p>•	Simple/Advanced Type</p>
        <p>•	Named Filter(s)</p>
        <p>•	Filter Field</p>
        <p>•	Filter Value</p>
        <p>•	Advanced Filters</p>
        <p>•	Sort Order</p>
        <p>•	Body Selectors (if used)</p>
